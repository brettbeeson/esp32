# esp32

It's a collection of components and projects for using on the Esp32! _These are works in progress. Don't expect them to work out of the box_. They use ESP-IDF v4+ with the cmake build system. Generally they use C++. Arduino for ESP-IDF is a requirement, although I'm moving away from this to use ESP-IDF directly.
